# correct_nameinput_capitalization
my name is Magyar-Hunor Tamas and i found websites (i remember iceland.co.uk webshop) not beeing prepared to take a 2 named user name with correct capitalization. resulting my name showed as Magyar-hunor Tamas which annoyed me a lot because i use Hunor as my first name.
so after i spent a few hours with Ruby i started understanding a few things i decided to dig into this and made a code for this which works with my name.

there is still plenty things to do as this doesn't work with people with more than 2 first and/or last names OR with ppl who have more than just Space or "-" between their 1+ first or last names. Also i didn't think of any other characters than space and "-" in the names so my code can not deal with those.

if you come across my code please do use as basic knowledge as possible so i will be able to understand the why's. i am sure there are much better and easier shorter ways to do this, but as you can see, i am not on that level yet :)

thanks for your time
Hunor
